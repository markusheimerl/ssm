A state space model implementation

Consider a linear state space model operating on sequential inputs of shape (seq_len × batch_size × input_dim). The architecture maintains internal states that evolve through learned temporal dynamics. The forward propagation follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
H_t &= X_tB^T + H_{t-1}A^T \\
Y_t &= H_tC^T + X_tD^T
\end{align*}
$$

The state transition matrix $A$ captures temporal dependencies, input matrix $B$ maps current inputs to state updates, output matrix $C$ projects states to outputs, and feedthrough matrix $D$ provides direct input-output connections. The linear state evolution $H_t = X_tB^T + H_{t-1}A^T$ enables parallel computation via scan algorithms.

For gradient computation through time, we apply backpropagation through time (BPTT), where $\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_t} &= Y_t - Y_{t,\text{true}} \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial C} &= \sum_t (\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_t})^T H_t \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial D} &= \sum_t (\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_t})^T X_t \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial H_t} &= (\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_t})C + (\frac{\partial L}{\partial H_{t+1}})A \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial A} &= \sum_t (\frac{\partial L}{\partial H_t})^T H_{t-1} \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial B} &= \sum_t (\frac{\partial L}{\partial H_t})^T X_t
\end{align*}
$$

The AdamW optimizer maintains exponential moving averages of gradients and their squares through $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, while simultaneously applying L2 regularization through weight decay $\lambda$. The learning rate is denoted by $\eta$, $t$ is the current training iteration, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability. For each weight matrix $W$, the update rule is:

$$
\begin{align*}
m &= \beta_1m + (1-\beta_1)(\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}) \\
v &= \beta_2v + (1-\beta_2)(\frac{\partial L}{\partial W})^2 \\
W &= (1-\lambda\eta)W - \eta\cdot\frac{m}{1-\beta_1^t}/\sqrt{\frac{v}{1-\beta_2^t} + \epsilon}
\end{align*}
$$

The implementation processes sequences through time-major matrix operations, where each timestep processes all batch sequences simultaneously via efficient BLAS operations. Each sequence evolves temporally as $H_0 \rightarrow H_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow H_{T-1}$ through purely linear dynamics, while maintaining expressiveness through nonlinear output projections.

The implementation leverages BLAS for matrix operations, enabling efficient computation on modern hardware.
